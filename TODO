===== jasmin wish list =====

- actual function calls (call/retq), ABI to be discussed

- fix ">>s" (should be SAR, is SHL)

- support addressing in nested for loops, e.g.,

  inline int i j;
  for i = 0 to 32
  {
    for j = 0 to 8
    {
      a[8*i + j] = x; /* this currently doesn't work */
    }
  }

- Support arrays of stack arrays, e.g., "stack u16[3][256] p"

  then pass p[1] as argument to a function expecting a stack u16[256]
